function [f,G] = my_tt_cp_fg(Z,A,Znormsqr,NDIRS)
%MY_TT_CP_FG Computes function and gradient of the CP function.
%
%   [F,G] = MY_TT_CP_FG(Z,A) calculates F = (1/2) ||Z - ktensor(A)||^2 where
%   Z is an N-way tensor and A is a ktensor or a cell array with N
%   factor matrices. It also calculates the gradient of the CP fit
%   function where Z is an N-way tensor and A is a ktensor or a
%   cell array with N factor matrices. The result is also a cell
%   array with N factor matrices corresponding to the gradients; in
%   other words, G{n}(:,r) is the partial derivative of the fit
%   function with respect to A{n}(:,r). 
%
%   [F,G] = MY_TT_CP_FG(Z,A,NORMZSQR) also passes in the pre-computed
%   norm of Z, which makes the computations faster. 
%
%   [F,G] = MY_TT_CP_FG(Z,A,NORMZSQR,NDIRS) updates the current components
%   based on the circular-shifted version of each response map in Z that
%   gives the min cost. NDIRS is the number of rows of the original 2-D response.
